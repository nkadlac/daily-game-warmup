- **Daily Recommendations**: Get personalized daily game suggestions
- **Game Categories**: Filter by difficulty, time commitment, and game type
- **Game Information**: Display game descriptions, difficulty levels, and links

## Technical Stack

- **Styling**: CSS3 with responsive design
- **Data**: JSON-based game database (initially static, potentially API later)
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages)
